          <p>
            Hello! I am a Korean national living in Manchester. I am originally
            from Busan, and lived there for 25 years. I decided to move to
            England and I have been here since March 2019 and l love living in
            England. I have experience in teaching and mentoring foreign
            exchange students whilst studying for my undergraduate degree in
            Korea. I taught students from Japan, Vietnam, Norway, Malaysia,
            Sweden and China. I have also taught basic English to middle school
            students during my time of university. I have 8 regular students who
            continue to progress at the moment. I love seeing this progressing!

          <p>Methodology</p>
          <p>
            I want to teach you about the Korean language alongside culture and
            history etc. I can teach you Korean depend on your interest of
            Korean food/ K-pop/K-drama/ Korean history ... I will give you
            material depend on your level of Korean. As I struggled to learn to
            English I know that learning a new language can be difficult and
            needs to be Fun! My classes are fun, engaging and tailored to meet
            your needs.
